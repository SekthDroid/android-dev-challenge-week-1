## :scroll: Description
<!--- Describe your app in one or two sentences -->
With `Adopt a Pet` you can search for different kind of pets and adopt them.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
<!--- Optionally point readers to interesting parts of your submission. -->
My motivation is to start doing something with `Jetpack Compose` and doing some research about this new paradigm. I have been looking at beautiful examples and with this challenges I'm able to test a little bit more about the library.
My workmates are doing the challenge too so we are all learning and talking about it.

<!--- What are you especially proud of? -->
Im really proud the app not crashing :D.

The truth is that the pets are not candidates to be adopted, they are my friends pets and they are beloved in their homes.
